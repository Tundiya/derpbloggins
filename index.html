Then I spent hours and hours rebuilding a blog type page, or at least the beginnings of one using bootstrap. This has been a journey! Today is feb.10.2024 I started the online course on the fourth. The course itself has touch on bootstrap very lightly so far and this includes things like creating the div container, setting up rows, defining the number of columns you want the content to take up (of 12), setting breakpoints in the divs, dealing with images and setting their class attributes to fluid etc. Up to this point I have only made webpages with straight html and css, never a library so this has been like starting over essentially. Although I can certainly see the benefits of using bootstrap already when you know what you want and how to get their the prototyping must be nutty! So today I started this project your looking at now and learned some valueble things. For example, how to use the bootstrap docs LOL that seems like its going to be my home for the next little while! I messed around with making some cards and seeing how that looked for the top of the page but I really didnt like it so I just added some title and subtitle rows as placeholders for more interesting things to come. I had a picture of myself on one of the cards but it seemed a little austentatious, maybe in the future I will find a better way to do this. A big win! I thought it would be cool to display a carousel that shows my previous attempts at blogs and with the guided assistance of the bootstrap documentation we made it! I added some css rules for additional control of the carousel element because I didnt want it taking up the whole width of the page, then I was having issues with the reference images being slightly different size and even that was figured out! The coursera classes are going very well and I think are a fantastic learning tool. I ripped through the introduction to frontend developement course package in 4 days and now I am deep into part 2 of 9 which is javascript. Re learning how to make else/if statements or switches if you prefer and make nested loops and even objects at this point. I feel like im missing some key ingrediants to better understand how the files and libraries should be packed before setting your webpage loose on the world. Oh well thats why I'm here! </p>
